# Roadmap

## MVP now (v0.1.x)

- FastAPI + pytest focused risk mapping
- Deterministic rule engine + optional LLM enrichment
- PR mode with impacted scope and fallback strategy
- Suppressions via `.airiskignore`
- Stable JSON metadata (`schema_version`, `generated_at`, `tool_version`)

## Next

- Additional rules for dependency and authorization risk patterns
- Better test-to-endpoint mapping precision
- Additional framework support after FastAPI maturity
- Optional blocking mode rollout by severity threshold
