# Security Policy

## Supported versions

MVP support is provided for the latest minor version on `main`.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not report vulnerabilities publicly in regular GitHub Issues.

Preferred channel:

- GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting / Security Advisory flow (repository Security tab).

If private reporting is unavailable, open a minimal issue without exploit details and request a private follow-up.

Include:

- Affected version/commit
- Reproduction steps
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Potential impact

General rules:

- Avoid posting secrets, tokens, private keys, or production credentials.
- Share only the minimum reproducible details required for triage.

Initial triage target: within 3 business days.
